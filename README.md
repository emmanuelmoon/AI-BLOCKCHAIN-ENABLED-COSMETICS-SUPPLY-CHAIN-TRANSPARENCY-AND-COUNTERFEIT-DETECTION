## 🧾 Project Overview

This project aims to address real-world challenges in the cosmetics industry such as **counterfeiting**, **opaque supply chains**, and **ethical sourcing verification**. It combines **Blockchain technology** for immutable record-keeping with **AI-driven analytics** to detect anomalies and predict demand.

By leveraging **smart contracts** and **predictive models**, we are building a system that not only ensures product transparency but also empowers consumers to verify authenticity and supports manufacturers in improving operational efficiencies.
