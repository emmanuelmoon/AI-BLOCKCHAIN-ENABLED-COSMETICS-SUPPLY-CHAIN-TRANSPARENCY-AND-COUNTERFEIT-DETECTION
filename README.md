## 🧾 Project Overview

This project aims to address real-world challenges in the cosmetics industry such as **counterfeiting**, **opaque supply chains**, and **ethical sourcing verification**. It combines **Blockchain technology** for immutable record-keeping with **AI-driven analytics** to detect anomalies and predict demand.

By leveraging **smart contracts** and **predictive models**, we are building a system that not only ensures product transparency but also empowers consumers to verify authenticity and supports manufacturers in improving operational efficiencies.

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ Blockchain Integration
- Immutable ledger for end-to-end supply chain tracking
- Smart contracts for automated quality checks, payments, and compliance

### 🤖 AI-Powered Predictive Analytics
- Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning (e.g., autoencoders)
- NLP-based textual analysis using BERT/DistilBERT for ingredient consistency checks

### 🔍 Consumer Empowerment
- Product history lookup via blockchain
- Real-time counterfeit alerts

### 🌐 Ethical Sourcing Verification
- Transparent tracking of raw material origins

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric |
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity, Truffle Suite |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express / Python Flask |
| **Frontend** | React.js / Angular |
| **Database** | MongoDB / PostgreSQL |
| **AI/ML** | Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers) |

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Input**: Suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners input product and shipment data.
2. **Blockchain Recording**: All events are stored immutably using smart contracts.
3. **AI Analysis**: Models analyze data for anomalies and predict trends.
4. **Consumer Verification**: End users scan/query a product to retrieve its verified history.
5. **Alert System**: Any flagged anomalies trigger internal alerts for review.
